# PLU Browser
This project is a Progressive Web App created in order to assist the workflow for new colleagues at my previous workplace. The idea of the app was to give cashiers an easy and efficient way to find the correct "Price Look-Up Codes" ("PLU codes") in order to charge the right amount for different fruits, vegetables, etc.
